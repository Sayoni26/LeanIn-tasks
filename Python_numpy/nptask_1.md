**Task 1**

* Write a NumPy program to test whether none of the elements of a given array is zero.
> Take user input.


* Write a NumPy program to test whether any of the elements of a given array is non-zero.
> Take user input.


* Write a NumPy program to create an element-wise comparison (equal, equal within a tolerance) of two given arrays.
> Predefined input can be taken.


* Write a NumPy program to create an element-wise comparison (greater, greater_equal, less and less_equal) of two given arrays.

**Input**
> x = np.array([72, 79, 85, 90, 150, -135, 120, -10, 60, 100])
> y = np.array([72, 79, 85, 90, 150, -135, 120, -10, 60, 100.000001])

* Write a NumPy program to create an array of all the even integers from 30 to 70.


* Write a NumPy program to create a vector with values from 0 to 20 and change the sign of the numbers in the range from 9 to 15.


* Write a NumPy program to create a 3x3 identity matrix, i.e. diagonal elements are 1, the rest are 0.


* Write a NumPy program to compute the inner product of two given vectors.


* Write a NumPy program to save a given array to a text file and load it.
**Input**
> A 4x3 matrix as input and when saved as text file it should have heading as 'cl1 col2 col3'
